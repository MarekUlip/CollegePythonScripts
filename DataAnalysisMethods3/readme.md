# About
This repository contains scripts used during my studies at data analysis. 
It works with clustering, clasification, decision trees, SVM, neural networks, regression and 
ensamble methods. Some things were not implemented and simply 
experimented with using sklearn library. <br>
Each script was usually written during seminar and finished at home so the code quality could be better.
# List of scripts
1seminar - works with rule set generation <br>
2seminar - works with clustering <br>
4seminar - again clustering <br>
5seminar - experiments with dimension reduction methods <br>
6seminar - implementation of decision tree (alas not very good :( ) <br>
7seminar - experiments with Support Vector Machines<br>
8seminar - experiments with neural networks <br>
9seminar - experiments with multiple classificators <br>
10seminar - experiments with regression<br>
11seminar - experiments with ensamble methods<br>
project - script implementing CFTree.
