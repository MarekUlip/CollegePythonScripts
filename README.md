# CollegePythonScripts
Repo containing most of the python scripts that I have written or modified during my masters degree studies. Code quality varies depending on how much time I spent on solving the problem.<br>
Folders include algorithms from various fields mostly data science.

# Folder description
<b>AlgorithmsForBioinformatics</b> - Contains scripts implementing various data structures and algorithms used at bioniformatics <br>
AplicatedAlgebra - Contains my project from applicated algebra which used SVD to deblur image blurred by gausian blur. It also contains unfinished project on jpeg compression. <br>
DataAnalysisMethods1 - Contains implementations of basic algoritmhs used at data science (mostly clustering) also basic implementations from networks science. <br>
DataAnalysisMethods2 - Contains implementations of advance networks science algorithms and models. Not very effictive because it cannot handle big networks (more than 10000 nodes - i used matrix instead of node list)<br>
DataAnalyisisMethods3 - Contains some implementations of clustering and classification algorithms but mostly scripts experimenting with sklearn implementaions of clustering, classification, neural networks and regression. <br>
MethodsForTextAnalysis - Contains implementations of methods used for text analysis (preprocessing, indexing, text search)<br>
Nonconvetional-algs - Contains implementations of biologically inspired algorithms (Particle swarm, SOMA etc.) and of nonconventional algorithms (neural networks, algorithms using chaos etc.)
